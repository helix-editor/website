Ranging from small quality-of-life improvements and fixes to large features
and refactors, Helix 22.03 brings some exciting changes. Helix is a modal
text editor with built-in support for multiple selections, Language
Server Protocol (LSP), tree-sitter, and now Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).

Before we look at the highlights, there are some administrative notes.
`master` branch changes are now published separately from the release
[documentation][docs]. Find the new `master` docs [here][master-docs].
Helix is switching versioning schemes. Expect to find new releases in
Calendar Version format: `YY.0M(.MICRO)`. We're aiming to cut regular
releases every two months or so. Check out the [changelog][changelog]
for all of the new features and fixes from this release.

With that out of the way, let's check out the highlights!

## Health-check

Helix 22.03 brings a new CLI flag: `hx --health`. Use the new health-check
flag to troubleshoot missing language servers and queries.

Check the health of all languages with `hx --health` or ask for details
about a specific language with `hx --health <lang>`.

## Experimental DAP Support

Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) is an abstract protocol for editors and debuggers
to communicate. It's very similar in spirit to the Language Server Protocol
(LSP), but built for debugging. Interact with the debug adapter with
`<space-d>`.

Note that the DAP adapter is experimental: it isn't yet documented, there may
be bugs, and the UX is a bit clunky. Contributions are very welcome!

## Incremental Injection Parsing Rewrite

One of the cooler features of syntax highlight driven by tree-sitter is the
ability to _inject_ a language into another language's document. For example,
if you're writing Markdown, you might use a code-fence like so:

    This is some rust:

    ```rust
    println!("Hello, world!")
    ```

Helix highlights the Rust block by injecting tree-sitter-rust. Injections
have been rewritten so that changes within are now parsed incrementally, which
is a big speed boost when editing documents with large injected blocks.

Along with this rewrite, Helix now supports _combined_ injections. For example,
when highlighting Interactive Elixir (IEx), we might have a block of code like
the following:

```elixir
iex> send(self(), :hello)
iex> receive do: (:hello -> :ok)
```

The IEx grammar injects tree-sitter-elixir into each line after the prompt
token. Combined injections cover the case where separate injected documents
must be parsed in one combined document, like so:

```elixir
iex> if true do
...>   :ok
...> end
```

Helix can now parse all three lines together. In the future this can be used
to add support for templating languages like EJS or ERB.

## Tree-Sitter Grammars Refactor

In the past, tree-sitter grammar repositories have been added to the Helix
repository as Git submodules. Submodules can be painful to work with though,
especially when there are more than 50 in a repository. Cloning, CI, and
packaging times have slowed down as language support has improved.

Helix 22.03 completely overhauls the system for tree-sitter grammars. The headline
is that **submodules are gone**! If you're working with the source, you can
now clone with a standard `git clone https://github.com/helix-editor/helix`.
So where did the tree-sitter submodules go? They've been replaced with two
new CLI flags: `hx --grammar fetch` to clone grammar repositories into the
runtime directory and `hx --grammar build` to compile them. Use `-g` for
short. Grammar repositories are shallow-cloned in parallel, so fetching all
60 grammars can now take as little as 6 seconds on a good connection.

If you're building from source or developing Helix, note that fetching and
building are included in the `helix-term` build step, so you should not
need to manually fetch or build grammars.

Additionally, if you would like to customize which tree-sitter grammars
you fetch and build, you may now add the `use-grammars` key to the **top** of
your `languages.toml`:

{{ asciinema(id="use-grammars", width="92", height="24") }}

If you're writing a tree-sitter grammar, you can try out integrating it
by pointing helix to your grammar's local path in `languages.toml` without
needing to publish changes to a Git remote:

```toml
[[language]]
name = "mylang"
# ..

[[grammar]]
name = "mylang"
source = { path = "/local/path/to/tree-sitter-mylang" }
```

Running `hx -g build` will build the grammar. Add some queries and you're
on your way to interactive grammar development.

## Up Next
