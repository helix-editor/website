And where but from Nantucket, too, did\nthat first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with\nimported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in\norder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\nbowsprit?\n\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me\nin New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a\nmatter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.

It stood on a sharp bleak corner,\nwhere that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than\never it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,\nis a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the\nhob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind\ncalled Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the\nonly copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\noutsi"]

Yes, these eyes are\nwindows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t\nstop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint\nhere and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\noff a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\nagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\nhis shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\ncorn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\ntempestuous Euroclydon.

Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the\nline of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in\norder to keep out this frost?\n\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\ndoor of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\nmoored to one of the Moluccas.

Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,\ndeceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight\ngale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a\nblasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of\nthe icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to\nthat one portentous something in the picture’s midst. _That_ once found\nout, and all the rest were plain.

One young fellow in a\ngreen box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\nmanner.\n\n“My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead\nsartainty.”\n\n“Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”\n\n"]

I then\nglanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\ncould see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,\nthe four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a\nwhale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a\nhammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a\nlarge seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in\nlieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone\nfish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\nstanding at the head of the bed.\n\nBut what is this on the chest?

But could it be possible\nthat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\nstreets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to\ntry it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy\nand thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious\nharpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit\nof glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my\nlife. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink\nin the neck.\n\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.

Such a face! It was\nof a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with\nlarge blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a\nterrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\nhe is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his\nface so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\nsticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks.

It’s only his outside; a man can be\nhonest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\nindependent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\nnothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\nsun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\nnever been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\nextraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\npassing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\nall.

As I live, these covered parts of him were\ncheckered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all\nover the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’\nWar, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still\nmore, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\nwere running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\nhe must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\nin the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\nthink of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own\nbrothers.

Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought\nthat this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\nmanner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened\na good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\nbut a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage\ngoes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,\nsets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the\nandirons.

Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\nfire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\nto be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the\nbiscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\noffer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to\nfancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these\nstrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\nthe devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing\nsome pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\nthe most unnatural manner.

The Counterpane.\n\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown\nover me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\nthought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\nodd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\ntattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no\ntwo parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his\nkeeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\nsleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I\nsay, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork\nquilt.

Let me try to explain them. When I was a\nchild, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\nwhether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\ncircumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I\nthink it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\nsweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\nwas all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my\nmother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\nbed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\nthere was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\nthird floor, undressed myself as slowly as p"]

And it was so light too; the sun\nshining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\nstreets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\nand worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\nstockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at\nher feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\nslippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to\nlie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and\nmost conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room.

For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\nfrozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet\never thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\nspell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided\naway from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it\nall, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in\nconfounding attempts to explain the mystery.

Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\nnow, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\nlast, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\nand he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\nthe floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\nif it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\nafterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself.

[9.522842, "i", ", do you see, was a creature in the transition\nstage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\neducation was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\nbeen a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\nhimself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\nhe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\nhis eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\nbeing much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\nones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him\nat the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\n\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\nQueequeg made,"]

He\ncomplied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\nmorning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\namazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\nchest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\npiece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\nand commenced lathering his face.

Breakfast.\n\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the\ngrinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,\nthough he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my\nbedfellow.\n\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\ngood thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper\nperson, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be\nbackward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in\nthat way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about\nhim, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.\n\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dr"]

This\nyoung fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and\nwould seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days\nlanded from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades\nlighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the\ncomplexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\nbleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.

Still, for the most part, that sort\nof thing is to be had anywhere.\n\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\nafter we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some\ngood stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man\nmaintained a profound silence.

Yes, it\nwas the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he\nwas a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in\nhis youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the\nministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy\nwinter of a hea"]

When he entered I observed that\nhe carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for\nhis tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot\ncloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of\nthe water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one\nby one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;\nwhen, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\n\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\nr"]

The wife\nof a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of\nred worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely\nheaded, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,\nconsidering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad\ntaste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both\nhands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple\ncast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still\nreverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if\nascending the main-top of his vessel.\n\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\nwith swinging ones, were of cloth-c"]

No, thought I, there must be some sober\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.\nCan it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies\nhis spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties\nand connexions?

Between the marble\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\nwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\nbreakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\nfloated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s\nface; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\nship’s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\nthe Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel\nseemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy\nhelm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling\noff—serenest azu"]

Its panelled front was in the\nlikeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed\nbeak.\n\nWhat could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this earth’s\nforemost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the\nworld. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first\ndescried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is\nthe God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.\nYes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;\nand the pulpit is its prow.\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. The Sermon.\n\nFather Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered\nthe scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away\nto larboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”\n\nThere was a low rumbling "]
[9.522998, "i", "of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a\nstill slighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was quiet again, and\nevery eye on the preacher.\n\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his\nlarge brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying\nat the bottom of the sea.\n\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a\nbell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he\ncommenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards\nthe concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—\n\n\n  “The ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,\n  While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down\n  to doom.\n\n  “I saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there;\n  Which none but they that feel can tell— Oh, I was plunging to\n  despair.\n\n  “In black distress, I called my God, When I could "]

A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned\nover the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon\nthe proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the\nfirst chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up\nJonah.’”\n\n“Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one\nof the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what\ndepths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\nlesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is "]
[9.523012, "i", "that canticle in\nthe fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the\nfloods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\nwaters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_\nis this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a\ntwo-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to\nme as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\nall, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly\nawakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally\nthe deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the\nsin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the\ncommand of God—never mind now what that command was, or how\nconveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things that God\nwould have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he\noftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we\nmust disobey ourselves; and it is in this dis"]
[9.523019, "i", "obeying ourselves, wherein\nthe hardness of obeying God consists.\n\n“With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men\nwill carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\nCaptains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks\na ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto\nunheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no\nother city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of learned men.\nAnd where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from\nJoppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when\nthe Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern\nJaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,\nthe Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the\nwestward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar.

Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with\nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the\nshipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So\ndisordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen\nin those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had\nbeen arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no\nbaggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany him\nto the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\nfinds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as\nhe steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for\nthe moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s\nevil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\nconfidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the\nman assure the mariners he can be no innocent.

He reads, and\nlooks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now\ncrowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah\ntrembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\nmuch the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that\nitself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the\nsailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him\npass, and he descends into the cabin.\n\n“‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making\nout his papers for the"]
[9.523039, "i", " Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless\nquestion mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.\nBut he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\nsail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,\nthough the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that\nhollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the\nnext coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing\nhim. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a\npassenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away\nthe Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage\nmoney how much is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written,\nshipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,\n‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with\nthe context, this is full of meaning.\n\n“Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose"]
[9.523268, "i", " discernment detects\ncrime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In\nthis world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\nwithout a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\nfrontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s\npurse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\nand it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\nbut at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with\ngold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions\nstill molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.\nNot a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his\npassage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m\ntravel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like it,’ says the Captain,\n‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock\ncontains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain\nlaughs lowly to h"]

All dressed\nand dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the\nlittle state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\nclose, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\nbeneath the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment\nof that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of\nhis bowels’ wards.\n\n“Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\noscillates in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\nwith reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\nitself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\nhung.

But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when\nboxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is\nshrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\ntrampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all this raging tumult,\nJonah sleeps his hideous sleep.

Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides\nof the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast\nasleep.

In all his\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\nand at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to\nhigh Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this\ngreat tempest was upon them.

For when Jonah, not yet supplicating\nGod for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his\ndeserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him\nforth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest\nwas upon them; the"]

But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never\nreached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed\nhim down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him\nalong ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked him\nten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped about his head,’\nand all the watery world of woe bowled over him.

Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness\nof all earthly effort.\n\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\nMoss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\nsnortings.

But there were some boobies\nand bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come\nfrom the heart and centre of all verdure.

The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted\nthe weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\nside, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor\nfellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all\nhands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,\nseemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in\none ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\nsnapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable\nof being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing\nthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale.

In short, he\nplainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck\nat the Try Pots.

There’s Mrs. Hussey.”\n\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\nMrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon\nmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\npostponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\nroom, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\nconcluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”\n\n“What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.\n\n“Clam or Cod?” she repeated.\n\n“A clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean, Mrs. H"]

But when that smoking chowder\ncame in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\nhearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\nhazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up\ninto little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully\nseasoned with pepper and salt.

After much prolonged\nsauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three\nships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the\nPequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;\n_Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated\ntribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.

The prospect was unlimited, but\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\ncould see.\n\n“Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye\nsee?”\n\n“Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though,\nand there’s a squall coming up, I think.”\n\n“Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\nround Cape Horn to"]

Can’t ye see the world where\nyou stand?”\n\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\nPequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now\nrepeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his\nwillingness to ship me.\n\n“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come\nalong with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\ncabin.\n\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\nsurprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\nCaptain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\nshares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\nof old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;\neach owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a\nnail or two in the ship.

For some of these same\nQuakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\nare fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\n\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\nScripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in\nchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\nQuaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.

Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common\nconsistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\nconscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\nhad illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn\nfoe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled\ntuns upon tuns of leviathan gore."]
[9.52396, "i", " How now in the contemplative evening\nof his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the\nreminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,\nand very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible\nconclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this practical world\nquite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\ncabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a\nbroad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,\nchief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted\nbefore, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from\nactive life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining\ndays to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.\n\nNow, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\nincorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\ntask-master.

For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,\nhe was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used\nto swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\ninordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When\nBildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking\nat you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch\nsomething—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at\nsomething or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished\nbefore him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian\ncharacter. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no\nsuperfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like\nthe worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\n\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\nfollowed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.

Ye have been\nstudying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\ncertain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”\n\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\nBildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\nand seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n\n“He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”\n\n“Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n\n“I _dost_,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n\n“What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.\n\n“He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling "]

I began to think it was high time\nto settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for\nthe voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid\nno wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares\nof the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to\nthe degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the\nship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my\nown lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the\nsea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt\nthat from all I had heard I should be offered at least "]

But I am one of those\nthat never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\nworld is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this\ngrim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the\n275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been\nsurprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a\nbroad-shouldered make.\n\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\nreceiving a generous share of the profits w"]

And I did not know\nbut what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\nshipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\nquite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\nown fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\njack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he\nwas such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\nus, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”\n\n“Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay\nshall we give this young man?”\n\n“Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “th"]

But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\ntransom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\nwithdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\nfor Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\nleft in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\nlittle as if still nervously agitated. “Wh"]

But no; there\nhe was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began\nto grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to\nbe sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\nholding a piece of wood on his head.\n\n“For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\nhave some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But\nnot a word did he reply.\n\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\nand"]
[9.524208, "i", " no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\nturning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\nit promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his\nordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not\nget into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere\nthought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy\nposition, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\nwretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide\nawake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\n\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\nday; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\nhad been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\nsun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but\nwith a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\nforehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\n\nNo"]

This is the reason why most dyspeptic\nreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In\none word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first\nborn on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated\nthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\ndyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\nin. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\nfeast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\nwherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the\nafternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n\n“No more, Queeque"]

Because, in the first place, he somehow\nseemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\nfrom his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\nthan one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\nfinally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\nreligion "]

We must\nhave Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,\nQuohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was\ngiven a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”\n\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon\nenrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.\n\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\nsigning, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know\nhow to write, does he?

Shan’t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it’s before the\nGrand Jury.” And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving\nme, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.\n\nAt last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound\nquiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the\nhatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward\nto the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a\nlight, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a\ntattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his\nface downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber\nslept upon him.\n\n“Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,\nlooking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the\nwharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what "]
[9.524396, "i", "I now alluded to; hence I\nwould have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\nmatter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. But I\nbeat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to\nQueequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to\nestablish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear,\nas though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,\nsat quietly down there.\n\n“Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.\n\n“Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him\nface.”\n\n“Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;\nbut how hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you\nare heavy, it’s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,\nhe’ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”\n\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\nlighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept"]
[9.524403, "i", " the pipe passing\nover the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning\nhim in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\nland, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\nchiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening\nsome of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house\ncomfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy\nfellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was\nvery convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs\nwhich are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief\ncalling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself\nunder a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.\n\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk\nfrom me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper’s head.\n\n“What’s that for, Queequeg?”\n\n“Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”\n\nHe was going on with some wild remi"]

The\nstrong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to\ntell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed\ntroubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and\nrubbed his eyes.\n\n“Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”\n\n“Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”\n\n“Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain\ncame aboard last night.”\n\n“What Captain?—Ahab?”\n\n“Who but him indeed?”\n\nI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we\nheard a noise on deck.\n\n“Holloa! Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger. “He’s a lively chief mate,\nthat; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so\nsaying he went on deck, and we followed.\n\nIt was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board "]
[9.524418, "i", "in twos and\nthrees; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\nengaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various\nlast things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly\nenshrined within his cabin.\n\n\nCHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.\n\nAt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s\nriggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and\nafter the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with\nher last gift—a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her\nbrother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward—after all this, the\ntwo Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to\nthe chief mate, Peleg said:\n\n“Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is\nall ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh?\nWell, call all hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”\n\n“No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said\nBildad, “but away with thee, fri"]
[9.524425, "i", "end Starbuck, and do our bidding.”\n\nHow now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain\nPeleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the\nquarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as\nwell as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign\nof him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But\nthen, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in\ngetting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,\nas that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he\nwas not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab\nstayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the\nmerchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\nconsiderable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the\ncabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,\nbefore they quit the ship for good with the pilot.\n\nBut there was not much chance to "]
[9.524431, "i", "think over the matter, for Captain\nPeleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and\ncommanding, and not Bildad.\n\n“Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at\nthe main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”\n\n“Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this\nwhalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the\nPequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known\nto be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\n\n“Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and\nthe crew sprang for the handspikes.\n\nNow in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot\nis the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be\nit known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed\npilots of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot\nin order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was\nconcerned in, for he never piloted any o"]

Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that\nno profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in\ngetting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice\ncopy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.\n\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\nand swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he\nwould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I\npaused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of\nthe perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for\na pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in\npious Bildad might be found some salvation, s"]

That was my\nfirst kick.\n\n“Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared.\n“Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye\nspring, I say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red\nwhiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I\nsay, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved\nalong the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\nimperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,\nCaptain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\n\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\nwas a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into\nnight, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose\nfreezing spray "]
[9.524453, "i", "cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of\nteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white\nivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from\nthe bows.\n\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as\nthe old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering\nfrost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his\nsteady notes were heard,—\n\n\n_“Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living\ngreen. So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.”_\n\n\n\nNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They\nwere full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in\nthe boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there\nwas yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and\nmeads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the\nspring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.\n\nAt last we gained such an offing, that the"]

The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging\nalongside.\n\nIt was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected\nat this juncture, especially Captain Bildad.

[9.524545, "i", "at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,\nconvulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,\nfor a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,\n“Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”\n\nAs for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all\nhis philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern\ncame too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck—now\na word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.\n\nBut, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about\nhim,—“Captain Bildad—come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard\nthere! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful,\ncareful!—come, Bildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck—luck to\nye, Mr. Stubb—luck to ye, Mr. Flask—good-bye and good luck to ye\nall—and this day three years I’ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in\nold Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”\n\n“God bless ye, and"]

He was by no means ill-looking;\nquite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\nclosely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,\nlike a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for\nlong ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow\nor torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was\nwarranted to do well in all climates.

Uncommonly\nconscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,\nthe wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline\nhim to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some\norganizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\nfrom ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And\nif at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more\ndid his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,\ntend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,\nand open him still further to those latent influences which, in some\nhonest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often\nevinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I\nwill have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck"]

Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in\nthis business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits\nof the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly\nwasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after\nsun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted\nin fight"]

Where, in the bottomless deeps, could\nhe find the torn limbs of his brother?\n\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\nsuperstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which\ncould, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But\nit was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\nterrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature\nthat these things should fail in latently engendering an element in\nhim, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its\nconfinement, and burn all his courage up.

He would hum over his\nold rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated\nmonster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death\ninto an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no\ntelling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;\nbut, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\ncomfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a\nsort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,\nabout something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and\nnot sooner.\n\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,\nunfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in "]

For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his\nlegs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.\n\nI say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his\npeculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,\nwhether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless\nmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as i"]

But Queequeg is already known.\n\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly\npromontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last\nremnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the\nneighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring"]

But no longer\nsnuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now\nhunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon\nof the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires.

The Pipe.\n\nWhen Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the\nbulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a\nsailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also\nhis pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool\non the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.\n\nIn old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were\nfabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale.

Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and\nignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with\nsuch nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were\nthe strongest and fullest of trouble.

But what was still more curious, Flask—you know how\ncurious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow\nseemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an\ninsult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row?

I am the architect, not the builder.\n\nBut it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the\nPost-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea\nafter them; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations,\nribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I\nthat I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful\ntauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a\ncovenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam\nthrough libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with\nwhales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There\nare some preliminaries to settle.\n\nFirst: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\nis in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it\nstill remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\nNature, A.D. 1776, Lin"]

Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\n\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\nground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\nThis fundamental thing settled, the next po"]
[9.525185, "i", "int is, in what internal\nrespect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given\nyou those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;\nwhereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\nwhale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.\nHowever contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\nmeditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\nfish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\nstill more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\nnoticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\nvertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\nthough it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\nposition.\n\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\nfrom the leviathanic brotherh"]

Now, then, come the\ngrand divisions of the entire whale host.\n\n*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and\nDugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\nincluded by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish\nare a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,\nand feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny\ntheir credentials as whales; and have presented them with their\npassports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\n\nFirst: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary\nBOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them\nall, both small and large.\n\nI.

Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was\nalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil\nwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a\ncreature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland\nor Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was\nthat quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable\nof the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\nexceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment\nand medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you\nnowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of\ntime, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was\nstill retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a\nnotion so strangely significant of its scarcity.

His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\nfrom which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin\nis some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder\npart of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\nend. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\nthis isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\nsurface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\nspherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows\nupon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and\nwavy hour-lines graved on it.

Of\nthese so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several\nvarieties, most of which, however, are little known.

[9.525616, "i", "estic peculiarity on ship-board, arising\nfrom the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown\nof course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\n\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced\nby the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\nand more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the\nperson now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\nofficer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\nusage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\nthose days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation\nand general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\ndepartment and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\nreigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\ntitle of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as\nsenior Harpooneer; and as s"]

Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\nharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\nin the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the\nboat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling\nground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand\npolitical maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart\nfrom the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\nprofessional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\ntheir social equal.\n\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\nthis—the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\nmerchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\nso, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\nthe after part of the ship.

Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as\nmuch outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the\nshabbiest of pilo"]

And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she\nis drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial\neven—then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her\nskysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether\nrelinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n\nNow, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\nvery ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\nhere. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\nEgyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\nFor though their progen"]

And that the Egyptians were a\nnation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general\nbelief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for\nastronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\nstair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with\nprodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were\nwont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the\nlook-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing\nin sight.

Of modern\nstanders-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\nand bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\nare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\ndiscovering any strange sight.

The\nthree mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen\ntaking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other\nevery two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly\npleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is\ndelightful.

In\nthe fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the\nIcebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\nre-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this\nadmirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\ncharmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\n_crow’s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s\ngood craft. He called it the _Sleet’s crow’s-nest_, in honor of\nhimself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all\nridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children\nafter our own names (we fathers being the"]

In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something\nlike a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is\nfurnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head\nin a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into\nit through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or\nside next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker\nunderneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather\nrack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and\nother nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his\nmast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a\nrifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask\nand shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or\nvagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\nsuccessfully shoot at them from t"]

It seemed as though, by some\nnameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the\nsame fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own\nmagnetic life.

On this hint, attempts have been made to construct\nelaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\n\n\n  *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by\n  an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\n  Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.

The sum is, that at\nparticular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating\nwhales may with great confidence be looked for.\n\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\nfeeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing\nthe widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his\nart, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be\nwholly without prospect of a meeting.\n\nThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\ndelirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,\nperhaps. Though the "]

Therefore, he must wait for the next\nensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had,\nperhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very\ncomplexion of things.

Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that\nin less than “ten minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a\nsurviving plank of her has been seen since.

Conversation turning upon whales,\nthe Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength\nascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily\ndenied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout\nsloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very\ngood; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set\nsail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on\nthe way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments’\nconfidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the\nCommodore’s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made\nstraight for the nearest port to heave down and repair.

I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.\n\nI will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance\nin point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you\nmust know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s\nfamous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.\nCaptain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:\n\n“By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day\nwe were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was\nvery clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to\nkeep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was\nnot till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up.\nAn uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship\nitself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived\nby any one on board till t"]

The masts reeled, and the sails fell\naltogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,\nconcluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw\nthe monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain\nD’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the\nvessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very\nhappily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”\n\nNow, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\nquestion, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\nadventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\nDorchester near Boston.

The ship, however, was by no means a large\none: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my\nuncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.\n\nIn that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,\ntoo, of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\nDampier’s old chums—I found a little matter set down so like that just\nquoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a\ncorroborative example, if such be needed.\n\nLionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the\nmodern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four\no’clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\nleagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which\nput our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where\nthey were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death.\nAnd, indeed, the shock was so "]
[9.527098, "i", "sudden and violent, that we took it for\ngranted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was\na little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * *\n* * * The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their\ncarriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.\nCaptain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his\ncabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and\nseems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great\nearthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief\nalong the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the\ndarkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all\ncaused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.\n\nI might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\nme, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\nthan one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\nboats back to their ships"]
[9.527105, "i", ", but to pursue the ship itself, and long\nwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\nPusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let\nme say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a\nrunning sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and\nsecured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a\nhorse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if\nthe sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,\nnot so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\ndestruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\nindication of his character, that upon being attacked he will\nfrequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for\nseveral consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more\nand a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,\nby which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous\nevent"]

By the best authorities, he\nhas always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating\nhistorian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting\nthe matter presently to be mentioned.\n\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\nof his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\nin the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed\nvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty\nyears. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot "]

But as he destroyed ships, as\nwell as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly\ninclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long\ntime I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the\nMediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am\ncertain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\npresent constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious\nresort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in\nmodern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the\nsperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on\nthe Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the\nskeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes\nthrough the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,\npass out of the Mediterranean into the Propo"]

If, then, you properly put these statements\ntogether, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\naccording to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for\nhalf a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\nprobability have been a sperm whale.\n\n\nCHAPTER 46. Surmises.\n\nThough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\nthoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby\nDick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that\none passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and\nlong habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether\nt"]

But if such an hypothesis be\nindeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,\nthough not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling\npassion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.\n\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in\nthe shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.

During that long interval Starbuck\nwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\ncaptain’s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him.

The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\nwere, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\natmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\nwater, also, the whales were swimming.

Until Cabaco’s published discovery, the sailors had little\nforeseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of\nport, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the\nwhaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then\nfound bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his\nown hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even\nsolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is\nrunning out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was\nobserved in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra\ncoat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better\nwithstand the pointed pressure "]

Nevertheless, so potent an influence did\nthis thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full\nknowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were\nthey governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among\nthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod’s main-mast.\nInterweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as\npublicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now\nproceed to put on lasting record.\n\n*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,\nstill us"]

Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\nto meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\nnot; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\ncommanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\nshovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a\npig to run at large.\n\n“Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household\nwork which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\nevening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\nfoundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\nsea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\nwould not willingly drown without first washing their faces.

Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\nunderstand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\nfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat\nstill for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s\nmalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him\nand the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\ninstinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness\nto stir up the deeper pass"]

But in order to insure the\nspeediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely,\nnot to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,\nspite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\nmaintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower\nfor a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\ncruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\nberth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\nvital jaw of the whale.\n\n“But though the Lakeman had in"]

The mutineer was the bowsman of\nthe mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,\nwhile Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or\nslacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats\nwere lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely\nwith delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a\nstiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney\nsprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.\nAnd now his bandaged cry was, to be"]

That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back,\nthe boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was\ntossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck\nout through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that\nveil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But\nthe whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer\nbetween his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,\nand went down.\n\n“Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had\nslackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly\nlooking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,\ndownward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He\n"]

All four boats gave chase again; but the\nwhale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\n\n“In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary\nplace—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the\nLakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted\namong the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double\nwar-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.\n\n“The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called\nupon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving\ndown the ship to stop the leak.

After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the\nship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon\nfrom the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the\nIslanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with\nhim, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight\nbefore the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a\nreinforcement to his crew.\n\n“On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which\nseemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from\nit; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of\nSteelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The\ncaptain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked\nwar-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the\npistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and\nfoam.\n\n“‘What do you wa"]

Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he\nleaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,\nstood face to face with the captain.\n\n“‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As\nsoon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder\nisland, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike\nme!’\n\n“‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping\ninto the sea, he swam back to his comrades.\n\n“Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the\nroots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due\ntime arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination.

Chartering a small\nnative schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all\nright there, again resumed his cruisings.\n\n“Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of\nNantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to\ngive up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that\ndestroyed him.  * * * *\n\n“‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.\n\n“‘I am, Don.’\n\n“‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,\nthis your story is in substance really true?

No wonder then, that in some sort our\nnoble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The\nHindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,\ndepicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly\nknown as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and\nhalf whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small\nsection of him is all wrong.

Nor does Hogarth, in painting the\nsame scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit better.\nThe huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the\nsurface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on\nits back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are\nrolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames\nby water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old\nScotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale, as depicted in the prints of old\nBibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these?

Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless\ncall this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so\nintended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an\nold Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\nRevival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\ncomparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\nspecies of the Leviathan.\n\nIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\nwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all\nmanner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\nBaden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the\ntitle-page of the original edition of the “Advancement of Learning” you\nwill find some curious whales.\n\nBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\npictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\nby those who know. In ol"]

In another\nplate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with\nperpendicular flukes.\n\nThen again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\nColnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round\nCape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\nSpermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to\nbe a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from\none killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.”\nI doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the\nbenefit of his marines.

Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not\ngive us Jonah looking out of that eye!\n\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the\nbenefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of\nmistake. Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In\nthe abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged\n“whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this\nunsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the\nnarwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this\nnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon\nany intelligent public of schoolboys.\n\nThen, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great\nnaturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\nseveral pictures of the diffe"]

All these\nare not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland\nwhale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long\nexperienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its\ncounterpart in nature.\n\nBut the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\nreserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\nBaron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he\ngives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that\npicture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary\nretreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s Sperm Whale is\nnot a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of\na whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\npicture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\nin the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that\nis, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with "]

Most of the scientific drawings have\nbeen taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a\ndrawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent\nthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.\nThough elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living\nLeviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait.

Not at\nall. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\nthat his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.

In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully\ninvested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so\nroundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the\nhead, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is\nalso very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which\nalmost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the\nthumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,\nand little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy\ncovering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. “However\nrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one\nday, “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.”\n\nFor all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\nconclud"]

True, one portrait may hit the\nmark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very\nconsiderable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding\nout precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in\nwhich you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by\ngoing a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of\nbeing eternally stove and sunk by him.

Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True\nPictures of Whaling Scenes.\n\nIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly\ntempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them\nwhich are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,\nespecially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass\nthat matter by.\n\nI know of only"]

Huggins’s is far\nbetter than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All\nBeale’s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in\nthe picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second\nchapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no\ndoubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is\nadmirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the\nSperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;\nbut they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.\n\nOf the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they\nare drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression.

Respectively, they represent\nattacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble\nSperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath\nthe boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the\nair upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of\nthe boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the\nmonster’s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single\nincomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the\nincensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if\nfrom a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and\ntrue. The half-emptied line"]

Serious fault might be found with the anatomical\ndetails of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I\ncould not draw so good a one.\n\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\nthe barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\nblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\nPatagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\nthat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\nmust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.

With not one tenth of England’s\nexperience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the\nAmericans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\nfinished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the\nwhale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale\ndraughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical\noutline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so\nfar as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to\nsketching the profile of a pyramid.

Hemp is a dusky, dark\nfellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian\nto behold.\n\nThe whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first\nsight, you would not think it so strong as it really is.

As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in\nrunning out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,\nthe utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some\nharpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,\ncarrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\nblock towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all\npossible wrinkles and twists.\n\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\nbeing continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in\nthis; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into\nthe boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas,"]

First:\nIn order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a\nneighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to\nthreaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\nharpoon. In these instances, the whale of course "]

Whole Atlantics and Pacifics\nseemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale\nsomewhat slackened his flight.\n\n“Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\ntowards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while\nyet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb,\nfirmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart\ninto the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately\nsterning out of the way of the whale’s horrible wallow, and then\nranging up for another fling.\n\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down\na hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which\nbubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake.

When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned\nhis long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully\nchurning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold\nwatch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of\nbreaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was\nthe innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting\nfrom his trance into th"]

At last,\ngush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees\nof red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran\ndripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!\n\n“He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.\n\n“Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,\nStubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood\nthoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.\n\n\nCHAPTER 62.

Now it needs a strong,\nnervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what\nis called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the\ndistance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting\nthe chase, the h"]

For one, I\ncannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same\ntime. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the\nfish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting\ncry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his\noar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the\ncrotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it\nsomehow into the whale.

It is then they change places; and the\nheadsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper\nstation in the bows of the boat.\n\nNow, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both\nfoolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from\nfirst to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no\nrowing whatever should be expected of him, except under "]
[9.529, "i", "circumstances\nobvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a\nslight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various\nwhalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast\nmajority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so\nmuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the\nharpooneer that has caused them.\n\nTo insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this\nworld must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out\nof toil.\n\n\nCHAPTER 63. The Crotch.\n\nOut of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in\nproductive subjects, grow the chapters.\n\nThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.\nIt is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,\nwhich is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the\nbow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of\nthe harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the\n"]

It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in\nthe crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.\n\nBut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\nthe line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\ninstantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the\ncoming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It\nis a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to\nthe instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon\nreceiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer,\nhowever lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into\nhim. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the\nline, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,\nbe anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else\n"]

And now, as we eighteen\nmen with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\nfingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse\nin the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long\nintervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of\nthe mass we moved.

Vacantly\neyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for\nsecuring it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,\nwent his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until\nmorning.\n\nThough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\nevinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the\ncreature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or\ndespair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body\nreminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand\nother whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot\nadvance his grand, monomaniac object.

Such an unwonted bustle was\nhe in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned\nto him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping\ncause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely\nmanifest.

In\nmost other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so\nlargely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably\ndiminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a\nprocedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems"]

I\nhave several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.\nIt is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed\npage, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a\nmagnifying influence.

That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I\nadmit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be\nregarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to\nspeak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of\nthe tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a\nnew-born child.

Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm\nWhale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially\nhis flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by\nreason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random\naspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,\nwhich Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact\nwith vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks must not a\nlittle resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular.

So strongly did he work upon his\ndisciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the\ncaptain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of\nthem would remain.

The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared\nlittle or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had\nbroken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the\nplague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be\nstayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor\ndevils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to\nhis instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.\nSuch things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.\nNor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the\nmeasureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\npower of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.

Meantime, the\nhoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was\nseen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel\nnature seemed to warrant.\n\nWhen this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\nconcerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from\nGabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy s"]

But when, some\nyear or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the\nmast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;\nand the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\nopportunity, despite all the archangel’s denunciations and\nforewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\nWith them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\nperilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron\nfast.

Next\ninstant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily\ninto the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea\nat the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was\nharmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the mate for ever sank.\n\nIt is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\nSperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\nSometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\noftener the boat’s bow is"]

Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their\noars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the\nPequod.\n\nAs, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket\nof the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild\naffair.\n\n\nCHAPTER 72.

It was\nmentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the\nblubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the\nspades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that\nsame hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my\nparticular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to\ndescend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to.\nBut in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall\nremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is\nconcluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,\nexcepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten\nfeet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,\nhalf on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like\na tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured\nin the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which "]

You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by\na long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg\ndown there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a\nmonkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\nwaist.\n\nIt was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\nproceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\nends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\nleather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,\nwere wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both\nusage and honor demanded, that instead of"]

Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of\ninterregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have\nso gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked\nhim now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\nto jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of\nmine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in\nmost cases, he,"]

The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.\n\nHere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us\njoin them, and lay together our own.\n\nOf the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\nWhale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales\nregularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two\nextremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external\ndifference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\nhead of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we\nmay freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\ndeck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to\nstudy practical cetology than here?\n\nIn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\nthese heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a\ncertain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right\nWhale’s sadly lacks. There is more c"]
[9.529719, "i", "haracter in the Sperm Whale’s head.\nAs you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to\nhim, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this\ndignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the\nsummit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he\nis what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”\n\nLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the two\nmost important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the\nhead, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you\nnarrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\nfancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\nmagnitude of the head.\n\nNow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\nthan he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s\neyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; "]
[9.529726, "i", "and you may fancy, for\nyourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\nthrough your ears. You would find that you could only command some\nthirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\nand about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\nstraight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\nbe able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\nbehind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\nsame time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\nthe front of a man—what, indeed, but his eyes?\n\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\nare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\nproduce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\nthe whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\nsolid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\ntwo lakes in valleys; this, of course,"]
[9.529732, "i", " must wholly separate the\nimpressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\nmust see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\npicture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\nnothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\nworld from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with\nthe whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\ndistinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\nwhale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\nto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\n\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\nvisual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\nhint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\nis involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\nwhatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience\nwill teach him, that though he can t"]

But if you now come to separate these two\nobjects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\norder to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\nbear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\nconsciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in\nthemselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\ncomprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the\nsame moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\none side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?

If you are an\nentire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for\nhours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\nwhatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\nwondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye.

If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,\nand expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,\nalas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these\nspikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,\nwhen fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there\nsuspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\nstraight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\nship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\nsorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his\njaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\nreproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon\nhim.\n\nIn most cases this l"]

Two hundred\nyears ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a\nshoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the\nnursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be\nlodged, she and all her progeny.\n\nBut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\naspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit\nand look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole\nhead for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in\nits sounding-board.

At any rate, when you watch those\nlive crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost\nsure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the\ntechnical term “crown” also bestowed upon it; in which case you will\ntake great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a\ndiademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for\nhim in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a\nvery sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower\nlip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by\ncarpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a\nsulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\n\nA great pity, now, th"]

Though the\ncertainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the\nsavor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we\nmust grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance\nwill seem reasonable.\n\nIn old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\nconcerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous\n“whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a\nthird old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:\n“There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his\nupper _chop_, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”\n\n*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or\nrather a moustache,"]

Sometimes these tufts\nimpart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\ncountenance.\n\nAs every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”\n“blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and\nother stiffening contrivances.

He has carried\nwith him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,\ntravelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that\nit hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it\nis caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down\nthe other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexter"]

There—still high elevated above the\nrest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish\nMuezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\nshort-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches\nfor the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business\nhe proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,\nsounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time\nthis cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like\na well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the\nother end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\nthree alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\nIndian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.\nInserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the\nbucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word\nto the seamen at the whip, up comes the b"]

Carefully lowered from its height, the\nfull-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly\nemptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through\nthe same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the\nend, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper\nand deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone\ndown.\n\nNow, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;\nseveral tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once\na queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild\nIndian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his\none-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or\nwhether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or\nwhether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without\nstating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling\nnow; but, on a sudde"]
[9.529922, "i", "n, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came\nsuckingly up—my God! poor Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket\nin a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of\nHeidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of\nsight!\n\n“Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first\ncame to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot\ninto it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip\nitself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost\nbefore Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there\nwas a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before\nlifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,\nas if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only\nthe poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous\ndepth to which he had sunk.\n\nAt this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing\nthe whip—which ha"]
[9.530126, "i", "d somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a\nsharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,\none of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a\nvast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship\nreeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,\nupon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be\non the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent\nmotions of the head.\n\n“Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand\nholding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he\nwould still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,\nrammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the\nburied harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.\n\n“In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge\nthere?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on\ntop of his head? Avast, will ye!"]
[9.530133, "i", "”\n\n“Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a\nrocket.\n\nAlmost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass\ndropped into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the\nsuddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering\ncopper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the\nsailors’ heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of\nspray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,\nburied-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the\nsea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked\nfigure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen\nhovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my\nbrave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the\nside, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,\nand no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands\nnow jumped into a boat a"]

Drawn into the\nwaiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was\nlong in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\n\nNow, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the\nslowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side\nlunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then\ndropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,\nand so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first\nthrusting in for him, a leg was pre"]

As for the great head itself, that was\ndoing as well as could be expected.\n\nAnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\nQueequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was\nsuccessfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and\napparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be\nforgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing\nand boxing, riding and rowing.\n\nI know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to\nseem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have\neither seen or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an\naccident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than\nthe Indian’s, cons"]

We have thee there. Not at\nall, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had\nbeen nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the\ndense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance,\nas I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of\nwhich sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking\nin this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted\nby the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it\nsank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair\nchance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.\nYes, it was a running delivery, "]

Only one sweeter end can readily be\nrecalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey\nin the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that\nleaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed.

And since the nose is the central and most\nconspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and\nfinally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that\nits entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect\nthe countenance of the whale.

Nay, it is\nan added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As\non your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your\njolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the\nreflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which\nso often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest\nroyal beadle on his throne.\n\nIn some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to\nbe had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head.

Few are the foreheads which\nlike Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,\nthat the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;\nand all above them in the forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the\nantlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters\ntrack the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this\nhigh and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\namplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the\nDeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\nob"]

Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;\nthough that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In\nprofile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic\ndepression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark\nof genius.\n\nBut how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a\nbook, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing\nnothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his\npyramidical silence.

This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one\nof the larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer\nconvex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call\nthis high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm\nWhale.

Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all\nround. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was\nthis, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the\nMediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere\nwithin three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much\nmore than three days’ journey across from the nearest point of "]

It is furnished with a\nsmall rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be\nhauled back to the hand after darting.\n\nBut before going further, it is important to mention here, that though\nthe harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is\nseldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on\naccount of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as\ncompared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks.

Then holding the lance full\nbefore his waistband’s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,\ncovering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,\nthereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon\nhis palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,\nbalancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless\nimpulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming\ndistance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale.

Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\ngills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\nis combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a\ncod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\nsurface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\nregular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by\ninhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\nnecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot\nin any degree"]

No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the\ntop of his head.\n\nIf I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\nindispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\ncertain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the\nblood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I\nshall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.\nAssume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\naerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not\nfetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\nlive without breathing.

So that for an hour or\nmore, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of\nvitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert\ncarries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\nsupplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\nindisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable\nand true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\ninexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,\nas the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon\nrising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period\nof time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested "]

And not till those\nseventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full\nterm below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates\nare different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale\nthus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\nhis reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,\nthat this necessity for the whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal\nhazards of the chase.

But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water\nor whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at\non this head.

Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,\nwhen in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale’s\nfood is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he\nwould. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\nwatch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating\nrhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\nrespiration.\n\nBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?

It is done by darting a short-handled\ncutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A\nwhale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not\neffectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying\nalong with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony\nof the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the\nlone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying\ndismay wherever he went.\n\nBut agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\nspectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed\nto inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first\nthe intervening distance obscured from us.

So that tormented to madness, he was now churning\nthrough the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and\ntossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own\ncomrades.\n\nThis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\nstationary fright.

Thus the\nmost vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the\nfishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,\nundisputed law applicable to all cases.\n\nPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\nenactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in\nA.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling\nlaw, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and\nlawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse\ncomprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the By-laws of the\nChinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s\nBusiness.

Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any\nother recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it\nplainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well\nas their intention so to do.\n\nThese are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the\nCoke-upon-Littleton of the fist.

Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up\nwith the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it\nbefore the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were\nremonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’\nteeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had\ndone, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had\nremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore\nthe plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,\nline, harpoons, and boat.\n\nMr. Erskine was counse"]

Erskine was on the other side; and he then\nsupported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\nharpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\nthe great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\nher; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\ntherefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then\nbecame that subsequent gentleman’s property, along with whatever\nharpoon might have been found sticking in her.\n\nNow in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the\nwhale and the lady were reciprocally illustrativ"]

Now the defendants afterwards took\nthe fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.\n\nA common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might\npossibly object to it.

I\nknow not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by\ninference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same\nway as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head\npeculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be\nhumorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality.

As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours\nfrom his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that\ncircled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the\nwhale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that\nis, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an\nunappropriated corpse.

No!” Upon which Ahab\nretired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\n\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the\nchains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of\nbag.\n\n“What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”\n\n“I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered\nthe Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very\nmuch. “But what are you holding _yours_ for?”\n\n“Oh, nothing!

But joking aside, though; do\nyou know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\nsuch whales?

There a queer scene\npresented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were\ngetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales.

Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\noff at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\nconstantly filled their olfactories.\n\nStubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from\nthe Captain’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a\nfiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from\nwithin. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\nremonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\nto the Captain’s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the\npest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\nindignations at times.\n\nMarking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, "]

He therefore\nheld his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\nconfidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\nfor both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\ndreaming of distrusting their sincerity.

While the Frenchman’s\nboats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb\nbenevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously\nslacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\n\nPresently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\nhoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while\nthe Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale.

Though the word ambergris is but the French compound\nfor grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber,\nthough at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far\ninland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.\nBesides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,\nused for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris\nis soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely\nused in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and\npomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for\nthe same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.\nSome wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.\n\nWho would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\nregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\nsick whale!

Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\naspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is\nthroughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to\nrebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this\nodious stigma originate?\n\nI opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\nGreenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\nthose whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea\nas the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh\nblubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,\nand carry it home in that manner; the shortness of"]

The\ninvoluntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\nhand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale\nline coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as\nto become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water.

Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if\nhe should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be\nleaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly\ndropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to\nthe boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind\nthat. We can’t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would\nsell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.

Hast seen the White Whale?”\n\nSo cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,\nbearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was\nstanding in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to\nthe stranger captain, w"]

He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of\nsixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round\nhim in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket\nstreamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar’s surcoat.\n\n“Hast seen the White Whale?”\n\n“See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,\nhe held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden\nhead like a mallet.\n\n“Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near\nhim—“Stand by to lower!”\n\nIn less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\ncrew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\nstranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the\nexcitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his\nleg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his\nown, and then it was always by an ingenious and very"]
[9.532105, "i", " handy mechanical\ncontrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and\nshipped in any other vessel at a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very\neasy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it,\nlike whalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea;\nfor the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,\nand then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So,\ndeprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether\nunsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly\nreduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain\nchangeful height he could hardly hope to attain.\n\nIt has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\ncircumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\nluckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And\nin the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\ntwo officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side,"]
[9.532113, "i", " by the\nperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a\npair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem\nto bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\nuse their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,\nbecause the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,\ncried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing\nover the cutting-tackle.”\n\nAs good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\nprevious, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\ncurved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.\nThis was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,\nslid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting\nin the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then\ngiving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to\nhoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the runnin"]

With his ivory arm\nfrankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab,\nputting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two\nsword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let\nus shake bones together!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can\nshrink, d’ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did’st thou see\nthe White Whale?—how long ago?”\n\n“The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards\nthe East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a\ntelescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”\n\n“And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from\nthe capstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he did so.\n\n“Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”\n\n“Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”\n\n“It was the first time in my l"]

Presently up breaches\nfrom the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white\nhead and hump, all crows’ feet and wrinkles.”\n\n“It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended\nbreath.\n\n“And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”\n\n“Aye, aye—they were mine—_my_ irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”\n\n“Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well,\nthis old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all\nafoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!\n\n“Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old "]

Seeing how matters\nstood, and what a noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I\never saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the\nboiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would\nget loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a\ndevil of a boat’s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I\nsay, I jumped into my first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the\nway, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped\ninto Mounttop’s boat, which, d’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with\nmine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\ngreat-grand"]

No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,\nwith a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after\nthe second iron, to toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima\ntower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,\nflukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was\nall chips.

But\nsometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of\nmine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a\ntime let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a\ntwelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in\nsmall tacks, d’ye see.

How long, prior to the year of our Lord\n1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous\nfish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out\nthe first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;\nthough for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant\nCoffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets\npursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not\nelsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were\nthe first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm\nWhale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the\nwhole globe who so harpooned him.\n\nIn 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,\nand at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape\nHorn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any\nsort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful "]

But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable\nhouse again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons—how many, their\nmother only knows—and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I\nthink, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the\nsloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South\nSea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling\nvoyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this\nis not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship\nof their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.\nThat ship—well called the “Syren”—made a noble experimental cruise; and\nit was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became\ngenerally known.

I boarded her once at midnight\nsomewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the\nforecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every\nsoul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine\ngam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his\nivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that\nship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever\nlose sight of it.

However, the masts\ndid not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that\nwe had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting\ndown the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to\nmy taste.\n\nThe beef was fine—tough, but with body in it.

They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,\nsymmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that\nyou could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were\nswallowed.

Hence,\nin the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and\nnatural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some\nspecial origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further\nelucidated.\n\nDuring my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\nancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew\nmust be about whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I\nconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam\ncooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper.

In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and\nLeyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their\nnaturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the\nnature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game\nin those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux\ncountry where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of\ntrain oil"]

Of this seventy-two\nfeet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty\nfeet of plain back-bone.

Ahab’s Leg.\n\nThe precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel\nEnderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to\nhis own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his\nboat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when\nafter gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so\nvehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it\nwas, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough);\nthen, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and\nwrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances\nlusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.\n\nAnd, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his\npervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the\ncondition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood.

And as Ahab, leaning over the\ntaffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a\nsmall vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed\nthereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was\nfilled with Nantucket soundings.\n\n\nCHAPTER 116.

[9.533305, "i", "—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,” cried\nAhab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”\n\nBoth were silent again, as one man.

The Quadrant.\n\nThe season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,\ncoming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would\nostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to\nthe braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed\non the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’s\nprow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon\nhigh noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was\nabout taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his\nlatitude.\n\nNow, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of\neffulgences.

So, swinging\nhis seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his\nastrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that\nposture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun\nshould gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention\nwas absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck,\nand with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him;\nonly the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was\nsubdued to an earthly passionlessness.

Up helm!—square in!”\n\nIn an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon\nher heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her\nlong, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one\nsufficient steed.\n\nStanding between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod’s\ntumultuous way, and Ahab’s also, as he went lurching along the deck.\n\n“I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full\nof its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,\ndown, to dumbest dust.

It was thus with the\nPequod’s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice\nthe whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a\nsight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted\nemotion.\n\nSome hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the\nstrenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and the\nother aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sa"]

Emblazonings, as of crowned\nBabylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a\ncrucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.\n\nLong maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time\nthe tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to\neye the bright sun’s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly\nsettled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward\nplace, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating\nwake.\n\n“Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot\nof the sun.

Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two\ncompasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.\n\nBut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the\nold man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it!

The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod\nthrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair\none had only been juggling her.\n\nMeanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said\nnothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and\nFlask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\nfeelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some\nof them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear\nof Fate.

Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?”\n\nThrottling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;\nand would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger\ncaptain himself, having stopped his vessel’s way, was seen descending\nher side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the\nPequod’s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was\nrecognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation\nwas exchanged.\n\n“Where was he?—not killed!—not killed!” cried Ahab, closely advancing.\n“How was it?”\n\nIt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,\nwhile three of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of\nwhales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and\nwhile they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head\nof Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to\nleeward; whereupon,"]
[9.534009, "i", " the fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been\ninstantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this\nfourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in\nfastening—at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell\nanything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;\nand then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing\nmore; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have\nindefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was\nsome apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals\nwere placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her\nthree far to windward boats—ere going in quest of the fourth one in the\nprecisely opposite direction—the ship had not only been necessitated to\nleave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to\nincrease her distance from it.

He desired that ship to unite with his\nown in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles\napart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.\n\n“I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one\nin that missing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat; mayhap, his\nwatch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back.

For God’s sake—I beg, I\nconjure”—here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had\nbut icily received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me\ncharter your ship—I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it—if\nthere be no other way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only that—you\nmust, oh, you must, and you _shall_ do this thing.”\n\n“His son!” cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the\ncoat and watch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy.”\n\n“He’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx\nsailor standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”\n\nNow, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel’s\nthe more melancholy, was the circumstan"]

But the captain, for some unknown\nconstitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not\ntill forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he allude to his one yet\nmissing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the\nearnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s paternal love, had\nthus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a\nvocation almost immemoria"]

Do to me\nas you would have me do to you in the like case.

But starting from his enchantment,\nGardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his\nboat, and returned to his ship.\n\nSoon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel\nwas in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,\nhowever small, on the sea.

Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could\ndiscover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down\ninto its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a\nwhite weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it\nrose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long\ncrooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\nundiscoverable bottom.

But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three\nboats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale\nchurning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,\nrushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered\nappalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him\nfrom every boat, seemed only intent on annihilatin"]

It is thou, thou, that\nmadly seekest him!”\n\nSetting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled\nto leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding\nby the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he\nleaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and\nfollow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,\nhe saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three\nmast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats\nwhich had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in\nrepairing them.

And now marking\nthat the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to\nTashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another\nflag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.\n\nWhether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to\nhis swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some\nlatent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\nWhale’s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly\nnearing him once more; though indeed the whale’s last start had not\nbeen so long a one as before.

As it was, three of the oarsmen—who foreknew\nnot the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for\nits effects—these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two\nof them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a\ncombing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man\nhelplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\ninstantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering\ns"]

Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars!\nBurst in upon him!”\n\nHearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled\nround to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,\ncatching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing\nin it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a\nlarger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing\nprow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\n\nAhab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands!\nstretch out before me that I may yet grope my way.
