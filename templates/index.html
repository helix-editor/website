            <h2>Multiple selections</h2>
            Multiple cursors as a core editing primitive, inspired by
            <a href="http://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a>. Commands manipulate
            selections which allows concurrent code editing.
            <!-- Editing is focused on being easy to reason with, even if it takes -->
            <!-- a keystroke or two more than Vim or Kakoune. -->

            Tree-sitter produces error tolerant and robust syntax trees,
            which enables better syntax highlighting, indent calculation
            and code navigation.

        <h2><strong>Frequent questions</strong></h2>

          <h3>Post-modern?!</h3>
          <p>It's a joke. If Neovim is the modern Vim, then Helix is post-modern.</p>

          <h3>Is it any good?</h3>
          <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434">Yes.</a>

          <h3>Are there plans for a GUI frontend?</h3>
          <p>Eventually, yes! We'd like to prototype a WebGPU-based alternative frontend.
          See the <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/39">tracking issue</a> on GitHub.
          </p>

          <h3>What about plugins?</h3>
          <p>While there is currently no plugin system available, we do intend to eventually have one. But this will take some time (<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/discussions/3806">more discussion here</a>).</p>

          <h3>How does it differ from Kakoune?</h3>
          <p>Mainly by having more things built-in. Kakoune is <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/design.asciidoc">composable by design</a>, relying on external tooling to manage splits and provide language server support. Helix instead chooses to integrate more. We also use tree-sitter for highlighting and code analysis.</p>

          <h3>How does it differ from Vim?</h3>
          <p>By starting from scratch we were able to learn from our experience with Vim and make some breaking changes. The result is a much smaller codebase and a modern set of defaults. It's easier to get started if you've never used a modal editor before, and there's much less fiddling with config files.</p>
